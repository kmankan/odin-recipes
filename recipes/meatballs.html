  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Tender meatballs filled with onions and Parmesan, bathed in plenty of tomato sauce, are classics in every way except for one: They call for turkey instead of the usual beef (or beef-veal-pork combination). Serve them over spaghetti or polenta, or stuff them into a hero roll for a sandwich. Try to use ground dark meat turkey here if you can, it has a deeper, richer flavor than ground white meat.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, more for serving, if desired</li>
    <li>½ cup panko or other plain dried bread crumbs</li>
    <li>¼ cup minced onion</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped chives or basil</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, grated on a microplane or minced</li>
    <li>1½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>Pinch red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
    <li>1½ pounds ground turkey, very cold</li>
    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed</li>
    <li>3 cups marinara sauce, more to taste</li>
  </ul>  
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine cheese, bread crumbs, onion, chives, garlic, salt, pepper, oregano and red pepper flakes (optional) and mix well.</br>Add turkey and egg and blend with your hands until well mixed. Chill for at least an hour or up to 24 hours. Form into 28 meatballs, each about 1¼-inches in diameter.</li>
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a pan. Brown meatballs in batches on all sides, adding more oil as needed. Transfer to a plate.</li>
    <li>Add marinara sauce to the pan and simmer, scraping up browned bits. Return meatballs and simmer until cooked through, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Serve hot, drizzled with more olive oil and sprinkled with more cheese (optional).</li>
  </ol>
